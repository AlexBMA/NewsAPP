With the glamour of Megève and Chamonix so close by, it’s easy to miss this collection of traditional villages tucked in between Mont Blanc and the Aravis range.

The vibe in the villages is relaxed, friendly, solidly French and geared towards families – they’re still very much farming communities that run all year round. With lots of recent snow in the Alps it’s a good bet for a last-minute Easter ski break this year. And it’s hard to resist a place that runs a festival that allows you to ski with eagles: the next <a href=\\\"http://www.valdarly-montblanc.com/fr/hiver/agenda/nouveautes/festival-aigles-a-ski\\\">Festival Aigles à Ski</a> is between 5-8 March 2018.</p> <h2><strong>Mountain lowdown</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image element--showcase\\\" data-media-id=\\\"0f9686136565eb4ee3bde4dcaa03993ff6bad80a\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f9686136565eb4ee3bde4dcaa03993ff6bad80a/0_108_4352_2611/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Val d’Arly, France\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> </figure>  <p>Notre-Dame and Crest-Voland – linked by a free ski bus – have the lion’s share of the slopes, most of which are sheltered, wide, tree-lined pistes.

Both Notre-Dame and Crest-Voland have direct links to much larger Les Saisies, which you can add to your lift pass, and two snowparks and six boardercross courses are scattered among the four villages.

You might spot some chamois on a snowshoe walk around Col des Aravis, which take place on Wednesday mornings. If the snow is too thin for dog-sledding in Notre-Dame, the exhilarating rides take place in the forests of Les Saisies. People of all ages flock to the outdoor ice-skating rink in Notre-Dame, which is open from 4-8pm.
